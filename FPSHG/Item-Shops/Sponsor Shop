The Sponsor Shop can be accessed only after a player has been killed, and eliminated from the match. 
Upon death, a player enters spectator mode, and can access the Sponsor Shop by first clicking a gold ingot in his or her hot-bar, and then choosing a player to sponsor by clicking his or her player head. In this shop, players can use coins to purchase items that are given directly to any player of their choice that remains in the match. There are eleven categories in the Sponsor Shop, each containing helpful items with which to sponsor players. These categories and the items purchasable within them are listed below.
